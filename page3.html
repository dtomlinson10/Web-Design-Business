      <h1><strong><u>What Are the Different Kinds of Web Design Businesses?</u></strong></h1>
      <hr />
      <h2><strong><u>freelancer</u></strong></h2>
      <p>
        One way of developing a web design company is by freelance means. This means that a person
        will work soley on the website, with no additional help, as a freelancer receives work from comapnies or people
        to work independently on the project. Therefore, this could affect the quality if only one person completes the work instead of a team.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2><strong><u>Advantages of being a freelancer</u></strong></h2>
      <p>
        There are many benefits of having a freelance approach rather than an agency when setting up a web design business.
        Some of these benefits include: the quality of the website, the costs may be considerably lower, and communication between
        the programmer and the client.
        <a class="linkref" href="Page5.html"><em>It is entirely possible to find a freelance designer who will deliver a
        higher quality website at a lower cost than a large agency. (shemakeswebthings, 2017)</em></a>
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2><strong><u>Agencies</u></strong></h2>
      <p>
        Another way of establishing a web design business is by having a comapny shared by all its employees.
        Therefore, all the equity is owned by the employees rather than one person. This means that many people can work on one
        website allowing the product to be more effective than if only one person has completed the product.
        As a result, this may drop development time dramtically and save costs.

      <h2><strong><u>Advantages of being an agency</u></strong></h2>
      <p>
        There are many benefits when considering an agency vs freelance approach when it comes to web design. These could include:
        a higher level of professionalism when dealing with clients; the efficency of the programmer; support after they have finished the website.
        An agency is regarded as being more professional than a freelance business due to working during office hours. However, a freelancer
        will only work and respond to the client when they have some free time. In turn, this could affect the quality of the product as well as the
        way the programmer
        presents themselves to clients. Furthermore, the efficiency offered by an agency
        will allow more opportunity for website production compared to a freelancer.
