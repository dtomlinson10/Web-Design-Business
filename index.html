        <h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>
        <p>
          A web design business is a business that creates websites for people or
          organisations based on their needs and wants. A web design business can be started in two ways,
          mainly as a freelancer or as an agency. The main coding languages used in web design are HTML, CSS and Java.

        <h3><strong><u>What is Web Design?</u></strong></h3>
        <p>
          <a class="linkref" href="Page5.HTML"><em>Web design covers not just the look and feel of a website,
          but also its overall structure â€“ often called the navigation.(Advice,2011). </em></a> This means that building a website is not just about the user
          interface but the code behind it, e.g. CSS and Java, that allows the website to have structure and behaviour, e.g. button pressing
          and using links to go to other sites etc. These elements provide websites the functionality they require for the user's criteria to be achieved.

        <h3><u>What is a Web Design Business?</u></h3>
        <p>
          A web design business is a business that creates, mantains and provides
          updates to websites so they are up to date with the latest trends and technologies. Web design businesses
          can operate anywhere around the world so the people working together do not ever need to step
          foot in the same room. However, it may be beneficial to work as a team in order to ensure the website is the best it
          can be for the customer, as most programmers have a range of creative and coding capabilities.

        Furthermore,<a class="linkref" href="Page5.HTML"><em>A web design business will allow you to work with clients from
        all kinds of companies and organizitions across many industries.(Anon,2022).</em> </a> This means that the more companies
        someone has worked with, the better the competence of the person is to achive the criteria set out by new clients.
        The entrepeneur, employee or team may not need to meet the client, or even each other, because websites can be made anywhere at any time.
        This allows the agent or freelancer to utilise the freedom of their own time, and can create websites wherever they happen to be.
