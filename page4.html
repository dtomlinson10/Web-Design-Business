      <h1><strong><u>Coding Languages  </u></strong></h1>
      <hr />
      <h3><strong><u>Html</u></strong></h3>
      <p>
        HTML is a programming language that is used to make and design websites.
        <a class="linkref" href="Page5.html"><em>Using your word processor, you can create headings,
        write in paragraphs, insert pictures, or underline text. Similarly, you can use HTML to structure
        and style text that appears on websites. (dummies,n.d.)</em> </a>
        Furthermore, HTML is the only program that can display a website, as a browser has to have the
        code HTML attached to the file in order to open it as a website. However, HTML
        has many different versions therefore the code could differ from one page to the next.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML is also the background of the website as CSS and Java both use HTML code to adapt and place styles
        onto the webpage. Consequently, without HTML the webpage would
        not display any content since CSS and Java cannot display any words or images but can manipulate the
        objects to appear in different ways. Essentially, HTML
        is the markup language of the website and without this the webpage would be blank.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3><strong><u>CSS</u></strong></h3>
      <p>
        CSS is another programming language used when making websites. This language adapts the code of HTML
        elements and applies attributes to them so they
        are displayed in a certain way which is more accessible for the client and viewer. Consequently,
        <a class="linkref" href="Page5.html"> <em>using CSS, you can
        control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, presenting your markup language using
        whatever design you like. (MDN Web Docs, n.d.) </em></a>
        Without CSS, a webpage would not be structured in the most effective manner, and the code would be far longer than if it was not used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some benefits of using CSS include: faster development time, improved user experience, and easy formatting changes.
        <a class="linkref" href="Page5.html"><em>With CSS, you can apply specific
        formatting rules and styles to multiple pages with one string of code. One cascading style
        sheet can be replicated across several website pages. (User, 2019) </em></a>
        Having a faster development time using CSS, means that the costs of making the website
        are lower and in turn, profits are higher. Having a better user
        experience makes the website appear more friendly and accessible to the user.
        Therefore, the user is more inclined to return to the website, or give a good review, so
        more clients may find the freelance business or agency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, CSS can provide easy formatting changes for the webpage, therefore, the whole webpage can change its font by
        adding one line of code to the CSS style sheet. This means that,
        the development of the website will be quicker as the amount of coding the programmer has to do is minimised.
        All these benefits add to the webpage to make it the best product it can be for the client.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3><strong><u>Java</u></strong></h3>
      <p>
        Java is the third and final part of the web design process. Java creates the behaviours of the website and
        Javascript runs the program on the webpage.
        Without Java, the webpage would have no behaviour and could not link pages together, create hyperlinks and
        have moving images or slides on a webpage.
        <a class="linkref" href="Page5.html"><em>The client-side nature of JavaScript allows developers to add interactive
        features that change and update a webpage
        without reloading a new copy of the page from the website.(Techwalla, 2015)</em></a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, Java allows the programmer to store information on the website if someone enters a username for example.
        Therefore, the website can have more features in addition to displaying items and text on the webpage. This makes the
        websites more useable and user friendly since shopping carts, login systems or a database
        system provides the webpage with additional behaviours. These attributes enhance the functionality of the website.
